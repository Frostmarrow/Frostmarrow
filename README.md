- Hi, I’m @Frostmarrow
- I’m interested in many things. Learning is a very vague and general way to describe what I like to do.
- I’m currently learning Rust
- I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- How to reach me: On GitHub maybe.
- Pronouns: Redacted
- Fun fact: Ants (and many others) are immune to fall damage.
